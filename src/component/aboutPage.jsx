              <p className="chapter-text">
                There was a time in my life when I was stuck in a deep fog of confusion, self-doubt, and inner chaos. Questions constantly circled my mind:
              </p>
              <ul className="questions-list">
                 <li>What’s wrong with me?</li>
                 <li>Am I weird? Am I less than others?</li>
                 <li>Why do I get so angry?</li>
                 <li>Why did I fail in 5th grade?</li>
                 <li>Why was I bullied in school?</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="chapter-text">
                So many such thoughts and emotions led me to feel small, broken, and disconnected like I just didn’t fit in.

              <h2 className="chapter-title">The Curiosity That Changed Everything</h2>
              <p className="chapter-text">
                I began seeking answers, not just to heal, but to understand why I am the way I am. Coming from a middle class family, I couldn’t always find answers at home. But that curiosity never left me.
              </p>
                <p className="chapter-text">
                In 6th grade, a life-changing teacher named Bhunje Sir introduced me to the lives and thoughts of great thinkers like Gandhi, Shaw, Einstein, and Socrates. From him, I learned something far beyond academics — I began learning how to live.
              </p>
              <p className="chapter-text">
                Somewhere along the way, I discovered the writings of Marathi literary legend Va Pu Kale — and his views on life, relationships, work, and philosophy struck something deep within me.

               <p className="chapter-text">
                 That early exposure made me realize that philosophy isn’t just theory — it’s a lens through which life makes more sense.
               </p>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 I started learning from people who had done personal development courses. I absorbed what I could from them, and eventually began doing my own courses — and more importantly, I practiced deeply.
               </p>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 I worked closely and voluntarily with teachers, coaches, and mentors for several years. This inner work became my foundation. I discovered tools to keep my past in the past, deal with issues powerfully, and find simplicity in thinking.

                 Then life hit harder. My father passed away. That was a very tough time for me — emotionally, mentally, and personally.
               </p>
               <p className="chapter-text">
                 Soon after, my marriage ended. I have an adorable daughter — but eventually, I went through a separation that left me shattered. Losing her regular presence was one of the most painful experiences of my life.
